# Data Science
These are data science projects.

## Prices

### Introduction
I chose to create this project because I wanted to develop a greater understanding of data science. This project uses training data to learn how to predict the average cost of houses in an area. To predict the price, this project requires the user to input four integers, the total number of rooms, the total number of bedrooms, the median age of the housing and the number of houses in the area. 

### Project Goals/Requirements
I decided to code this project using python because I wanted to create a text based program which would enable the user to input data and I felt that this programming language would be most suited to me developing a project with these features. 

### Design
The user interacts with the computer by text. They are asked to input data into the computer. There are no buttons, typing into a box is the only way in which the user can interact with the program.

Firstly, the algorithm imports what is necessary to perform the needed operations and checks the data before displaying it in a series of tables. Then, certain features from the data (the total number of rooms, the total number of bedrooms, the median age of the housing and the number of houses in the area) are selected to estimate the average price of housing in that area. A new graph is shown which only displays these components. The user then inputs a value for each of these before the computer predicts what the average price of housing in that area would be.

### Evaluation
I feel that this project went well as it enabled me to successfully achieve a greater understanding of how computers learn and I was able to create a project which analysed data and was able to make predictions based on that data.

## Sentences

### Introduction
I decided to create this project because I wanted to gain a greater understanding of data science and how artificial intelligence is used to gather information. This project decides which words in a sentence are important and which are not.

### Project Goals/Requirements
I decided to use python to create this project because I wanted to create a text based program that could analyse data which would enable the user to input data and I felt that I would be able to best create this if I used the programming language python.

### Design
This program does not have a graphical user interface and this is a text based program, therefore the user interacts with the computer by inputting data using text. There are no buttons as the user uses the keyboard to type the data which they wish to input. 

Firstly, the program imports what is necessary to perform the needed operations and to analyse the sentences. The program then tells one of those installations, “spaCy” that the language which these sentences are written in is English. Next, the program prints out a statement saying that if the word “True” is printed next to the word, then it is unimportant. However, if the word “False” is printed next to the word, then it is important. The user then inputs a sentence and the computer determines whether each word contributes to the overall meaning of the sentence or not.

Afterwards, the computer uses the phrase matcher which was imported from spaCy to decide what an extract from a website is most likely to be talking about out of a given list of words.

### Evaluation
I feel that this project went well as it enabled me to successfully achieve a greater understanding of how computers learn as well as how they analyse text and data. Additionally, I was able to create a project which analysed text and was able to make statements based on that data.

## Global Warming

### Introduction
I chose to create this project because I wanted to develop a greater understanding of data science. This project attempts to prove that climate change is real by drawing graphs showing the average temperature rising whilst the uncertainty about those temperatures is going down. 

### Project Goals/Requirements
I decided to code this in python because I wanted to use “matplotlib.pyplot” to draw the graphs and present the data. I also wanted to use “pandas” to allow the computer to read the data. Additionally, I felt that python would be the language where I could best create a project which would display data.

### Design
This program does not have a user interface, its only purpose is to display the data contained in the data sets. There is no way for the user to interact with the computer. 

Firstly, the computer imports what is necessary to read the files and present the data. The computer then draws a table of the data. Afterwards, the computer calculates the average temperature and the average deviation. Then the computer shows graphs proving that the average temperature is going up whilst the uncertainty is going down.

### Evaluation
I felt that this project went well because I succeeded in creating a project which could display data of the average temperature each year in the form of graphs in order to prove that climate change is happening as the user would be able to see a rise in the mean temperature.
