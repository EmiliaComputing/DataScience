# Data Science
These are data science projects.

## Prices

### Introduction
I chose to create this project because I wanted to develop a greater understanding of data science. This project uses training data to learn how to predict the average cost of houses in an area. To predict the price, this project requires the user to input four integers, the total number of rooms, the total number of bedrooms, the median age of the housing and the number of houses in the area. 

### Project Goals/Requirements
I decided to code this project using python because I wanted to create a text based program which would enable the user to input data and I felt that this programming language would be most suited to me developing a project with these features. 

### Design
The user interacts with the computer by text. They are asked to input data into the computer. There are no buttons, typing into a box is the only way in which the user can interact with the program.

Firstly, the algorithm imports what is necessary to perform the needed operations and checks the data before displaying it in a series of tables. Then, certain features from the data (the total number of rooms, the total number of bedrooms, the median age of the housing and the number of houses in the area) are selected to estimate the average price of housing in that area. A new graph is shown which only displays these components. The user then inputs a value for each of these before the computer predicts what the average price of housing in that area would be.

### Evaluation
I feel that this project went well as it enabled me to successfully achieve a greater understanding of how computers learn and I was able to create a project which analysed data and was able to make predictions based on that data.
